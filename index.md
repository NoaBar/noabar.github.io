Contraception Quiz
===================
Answer the questions to find out which contraception method could be good for you.<br/>
As a woman and a social worker who used to work with adolescents, sexual education is a big part of my life.
In this app I wanted to combine my knowledge of contraception methods, responsive UX and programming.
The way every answer influences the final result is visible through the point counter underneath every image,
to help the user understand what led to the final contraception method suggestion.

Inventory
==========
In an attempt to contribute to my workplace, 
this inventory app is tailored to the use of a restaurant.
With the possibility to add and edit any product, the app makes the task of keeping track of the inventory easier.

Just Java
=========
An easy way for a business to get orders from its customers.<br/>
The "Just Java" app is an example of a simple ordering app that every business can adapt and use according to its needs.
Building this app, I gained experience working with an _explicit intent_, which allows an app connect with other apps on the same mobile phone.

City Tour
=========
Jerusalem is my home town, and there is always something new to learn or find in this amazing city.  
Using a few fragments and one menu I built a simple app for the use of tourists, new students,
young and senior residents.  
The app gives information and allows the users to navigate to the selected attraction using Google Maps.

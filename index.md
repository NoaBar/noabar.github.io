Contraception Quiz
===================
Answer the questions to find out which contraception method could be good for you.
As a woman and a social worker who used to work with adolescents, sexuall education takes a big part in my life.
In this app I wanted to combine my knowledg of contraception methods and programming.
The way every answer influences the final result is visible through the points counter underneath every image,
to help the user understand what led to the final contraception method suggestion.

Just Java
=========
An easy way for a business to get orders from its customers is throught an ordering app.
The "Just Java" app is an example of a simple ordering app that every business can build and use according to its' needs.  
Building the "Just Java" app I gained experience working with an "explicit intent" that allows an app connect with other apps on the same mobile phone.

City Tour
=========
Jerusalem is my home town.
Using few fragments and one menu I tried to build a simple app for the use of tourists, new students,
young and senior residents

because there is always something new to learn or find in this amazing city.
